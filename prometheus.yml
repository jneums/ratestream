  # --- Core App Information ---
  name: RateStream

  why_this_app: Smart contracts require financial data they can trust. Off-chain APIs introduce centralization and security risks, while the native XRC requires complex cycle management for every call. RateStream solves both problems by acting as a simple, verifiable bridge to the official XRC. It provides a standardized MCP interface that handles cycle payments automatically, making on-chain financial data easily and reliably accessible to the entire ecosystem.
  key_features:
    - "Powered by the Official XRC: All data is sourced directly from the Internet Computer's canonical Exchange Rate Canister for maximum trust."
    - "Simplified Cycle Management: The required 1B cycle deposit for XRC calls is handled automatically, abstracting away complexity."
    - "Broad Asset Support: Get rates for any combination of cryptocurrency (ICP, BTC, ETH) and fiat (USD, EUR, JPY) assets."
    - "Historical Data: Request exchange rates for any point in time by providing an optional timestamp."
    - "Standardized MCP Tool Call: A simple, predictable interface for easy integration with AI agents and other smart contracts."
